My primary research interests are hash function analysis, graph theory, and quantum approximation algorithms. The focus of my hash function research is to use boolean fourier analysis to better understand the structure exploited by existing attacks, such as the one presented in [How to Break MD5 and Other Hash Functions](http://merlot.usc.edu/csac-f06/papers/Wang05a.pdf). Outside of school, I enjoy hiking and backpacking.
